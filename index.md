Please note Windows Defender will open up a prompt so before you can install the Mastre client you will need to do the following steps:

After you have downloaded the install file which ends in a .exe you double click it to open

1) Click on More Info on the screen that appears:

2) Click on Run anyway that appears at the bottom:
